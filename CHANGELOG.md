## 1.1.1 (June 28, 2022)
- chore: updated package.json, updated package-lock.json, updated CHANGELOG.md, bumped 1.1.0 -> 1.1.1
- bugfix: un-capitalised first letter of changelog entry for ver-bump's own commit msg - because the rest of commit messages are lowercase (personal preference... see next bullet) - probably best left to the user to capitalise or not, perhaps don't enforce it (added future option to TODO.md) - updated BATS test case for changelog output assert test
- docs: moved todos into TODO.md
- docs: add demo GIF
- merge: branch 'stable' into main
- merge: branch 'release-1.1.0' into stable

## 1.1.0 (June 26, 2022)

- feat: added previously implemented options to the CLI help prompt

- chore:  small refactor + capitalise first letter of changlog entry for files that ver-bump changes - following from d4770e5
- feat: fixes #15 added -l argument to the CLI for optional pausing right after changelog is created, - the default previously was to pause and wait for the user to check the changelog and press enter to continue - the default now is to bypass the prompt and make it optional by supplying the -l argument
- feat: added option to add a commit message prefix - By default "chore:  " is used
- refactor: change changelog & commit msg for changes the script makes -> lowercase
- tests: add fetch remote tags - fixes bats test failing when git history needs to be retrieved
- tests: changed versionfile bump tool from sed -> jq
- tests: Fixed changelog.md test
- chore: cleaned up unnecessary comments
- tests: fixed check-tag-exists assert
- tests: added test: check tag doesn't exist
- tests: changed functions to pass shellcheck - the `` Command Substitution that was changed to $() notation is difficult to make work, because of needed multiple double quotes, hence made them pass using exceptions
- chore: moved functions around for correct order
- merge: branch 'chore-unit-tests' into main - merge to add all the new testing functions to github actions
- tests: created test runner action
- chore: renamed test runner npm task for clarity

- refactor: corrected do-changelog message about existing file
- refactor: corrected function name
- docs: moved TODO.md inside README.md + deleted file
- tests: clean up test set-up + added tests - added test for do-packagefile-bump - added test for bump-json-files success + failure + if no version is found (3 tests) - added test for check-tag-exists - added test for do-changelog
- tests: add bats-mock submodule
- tests: Update npm test run cmds + update Bats module
- Merge branch 'main' into chore-unit-tests
- Merge branch 'refactor-tests' into main
- tests: Added install script for BATS test runner
- tests: First commit of batch of unit tests
- refactor: abstractified version suggestion algorithm + changed the new desired version number var name + cleanup
- refactor(for tests): changed exit codes for proper error handling in tests
- refactor(for tests): disable msg styles when sourced + move main functions into main loop - separated styles and icons in prep for test regime, as the styles within the echo statements made them untestable - grabbing output with formatting failed when compared to plain text, or text with the same escape characters. - now the styles don't load when ver-bumped is sourced for testing with BATS
